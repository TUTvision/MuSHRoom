Metaverse technologies demand accurate, real-time, and immersive modeling on consumer-grade hardware for both non-human perception (e.g., drone/robot/autonomous car navigation) and immersive technologies like AR/VR, requiring both structural accuracy and photorealism. However, there exists a knowledge gap in how to apply geometric reconstruction and photorealism modeling (novel view synthesis) in a unified framework. 

To address this gap and promote the development of robust and immersive modeling and rendering with consumer-grade devices, first, we propose a real-world Multi-Sensor Hybrid Room Dataset (MuSHRoom). Our dataset presents exciting challenges and requires state-of-the-art methods to be cost-effective, robust to noisy data and devices, and can jointly learn 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, instead of treating them as separate tasks, making them ideal for real-world applications. Second, we benchmark several famous pipelines on our dataset for joint 3D mesh reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Finally, in order to further improve the overall performance, we propose a new method that achieves a good trade-off between the two tasks. Our dataset and benchmark show great potential in promoting the improvements for fusing 3D reconstruction and high-quality rendering in a robust and computationally efficient end-to-end fashion. The dataset will be made publicly available.

### kinect_tools

After capturing videos with Kinect, we first extract raw images, depth, pose, and point cloud of each keyframe.
```
python kinect_tools/1_process_rawvideo_perframe.py --input room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture --output room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture
```

Saving pose of each keyframe in the "pose" folder to a json file.
```
python kinect_tools/2_generate_train_transformations.py --input room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture
```

We fuse the point cloud of each keyframe of the whole sequences or of the training frames.
```
python kinect_tools/3_fuse_point_cloud_train.py --input room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture --pose_scale all/train
```

We render z-buffer depth from point clouds constructed with all frames or training frames.
```
python kinect_tools/4_generate_zbuf_depth.py —datadir room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture —pose_scale all/train
```

We complete raw depth with z-buffer depth. Depth completed from “pointcloud_train.ply” will be used for testing within a single sequence, depth completed from “pointcloud_all.ply” will be used for testing with a different sequence.
```
python kinect_tools/5_complete_depth.py —datadir room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture —pose_scale all/train
```

Data used for testing [NeuS-facto](https://github.com/autonomousvision/sdfstudio) with testing within a single sequence protocol can be generated from
```
python kinect_tools/6_generate_sdf_within.py —input_path room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture —output_path room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture/sdf_dataset_train —type sensor_depth
```

Data used for testing NeuS-facto with testing with a different sequence protocol can be generated from
```
python kinect_tools/8_generate_sdf_different.py —input_path room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture —output_path room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture/sdf_dataset_all —type sensor_depth 
```

The aligned poses for short capture can be generated from:
```
python kinect_tools/9_generate_sdf_short_different.py —input_path room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/
```


Since poses used for testing with a different sequence protocol are optimized by COLMAP, the whole point cloud can be transferred to new coordination by:
```
python kinect_tools/3_fuse_point_cloud_all.py —input room_datasets/${room_name}/kinect/long_capture 
```

### iphone_tools

Data used for testing NeuS-facto with testing within a single sequence protocol can be generated from
```
python iphone_tools/1_nerfstudio_to_sdfstudio_within.py —data room_datasets/${room_name}/iphone/long_capture —output-dir room_datasets/${room_name}/iphone/long_capture/sdf_dataset_train —data-type polycam —scene-type indoor —sensor-depth 
```

Data used for testing NeuS-facto with testing with a different sequence protocol can be generated from
```
python iphone_tools/2_nerfstudio_to_sdfstudio_different.py —data room_datasets/${room_name}/iphone/long_capture —output-dir room_datasets/${room_name}/iphone/long_capture/sdf_dataset_all —data-type colmap —scene-type indoor —sensor-depth 
```
(The “koivu” and “activity” rooms are exception. The —data-type needs to be set to “polycam”)

The aligned poses for short capture can be generated from:
```
python iphone_tools/3_nerfstudio_to_sdfstudio_short_different.py —input_dir room_datasets/${room_name}/iphone/ —scene-type indoor 
```
